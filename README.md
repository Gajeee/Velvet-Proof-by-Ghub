## About

**Velvet Proof** is a minimalist, dark-themed personal alcohol blog built as a **tasting journal**, not a review site.

It captures:
- What a drink tastes like  
- When it feels right to drink it  
- The mood, memory, or moment tied to it  

There are no rankings, no promotions, and no recommendations — just personal notes, quietly archived.

> _This project is intentionally slow, personal, and editorial._

## Design Philosophy

- Dark, premium, bar-inspired UI  
- Minimal color palette (charcoal, amber, deep red)  
- Smooth hover states and subtle motion  
- Mood-based navigation instead of categories  

Every design choice is meant to feel like:
> sitting in a dim bar, after midnight, with nothing to rush.
